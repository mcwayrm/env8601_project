# Earth Economy Modeling for APEC ENV 8601 -- Natural Resources
### Country: Belize
### Year: 

# Description: 
This project is an application of the GTAP-InVEST earth economy modeling approach to estimate global-local-global estimates of the influence of ecosystem services on a computable general equilibrium of a national economy. Below are the main steps performed in this analysis as well as a discussion of the results. 


## Step 1

### Use SEALS to generate a LULC map for 2030, 2035, and 2040. Estimate this for SSP1 and SSP5.

The code for this estimation can be found [here](). To do this, I changed lines ... and replace ... in the input datasets ...

### Plot these 6 maps.

#### LULC 2030 with SSP1

#### LULC 2030 with SSP5

#### LULC 2035 with SSP1

#### LULC 2035 with SSP5

#### LULC 2040 with SSP1

#### LULC 2040 with SSP5


### Add a new policy layer preventing or encouraging a type of land-use change. 

The policy I apply is ... To implement this, I change ...

Here are the results from that...

#### LULC 2030 with SSP1

#### LULC 2030 with SSP5

#### LULC 2035 with SSP1

#### LULC 2035 with SSP5

#### LULC 2040 with SSP1

#### LULC 2040 with SSP5

### Provide a narrative of how the different scenerios changed when this land use class was expanded or contracted. 

Here is a description visually comparing the two sets of graphs. 

## Step 2

### Using the first set of LULC maps from SEALS, assess ecosystem service provision for carbon storage, water yield, pollination, sediment retention, and nutrient retention using the InVEST ecosystem service modeling. 

I completed this run. Any problems that I needed to resolve for a successful run. 

### Show the plots for these ecosystem services

#### Ecosystem Service: Carbon Storage

#### Ecosystem Service: Water Yield (Supply)

#### Ecosystem Service: Pollination

#### Ecosystem Service: Sediment Retention

#### Ecosystem Service: Nutrient Retention


### Describe how the various scenerios differ with respect to the different ecosystem services. 

Here I discuss what visually increases and decreases. Are there hotstops in the country?

### Write an executive summary for what the policy maker interested in "green economic development" should know. 

Here is my executive summary. Avoid SSP5 as a counterfactual. value in ...

## Step 3 

### Post and organize code from this semester. Add a README.md 

This README file so far has described the final project analysis and the results. In addition, for the APEC 8601 natural resource course, we produced some empirical results using python code. I elaborate on this below. 

- In [problem set 02](./problem_sets/problem_set_2_mcway.pdf) I work with the DICE model for optimal production considering the damages from global warming. Additionally, I work with the MAGICC model to show the projected global temperature under different RCP scenerios through 2100.
- In [problem set 04](./problem_sets/problem_set_4.pdf) I run the InVEST ecosystem services model to estimate the ecosystem service benefits from crop pollination. 

### Make the repository public. Submit Repo to Canvas.
